This repository contains my Virtual Reality Environment of a fantasy forest.

You find yourself in a forest, at night. A magical, glowing wishing well lies ahead just beyond some trees, sitting in the center of the forest. 

The wind blows the trees and they sway as you complete this adventure...

Follow the glowing mushroom path to the wishing well.

Your task is to find the wish token to toss it into the well and make your wish. 

Following the signs, you can navigate to a meadow where you will find a map.

The map leads you to Crystal Corner â€“ a vital clue in finding the wish token.

This environment has:
- Two travel techniques: scaled walking and teleportation
- Ray-casting
- Wayfinding aids
- Realistic physics
- Ambient 3D sound
- Location specific sounds and sound effects
- Virtual assets
- Interactions with virtual objects

Developed with Unity and C# Scripts
